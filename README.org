#+TITLE: Swarmer: a Swarm Cluster Maker

* Description

Swarmer is an open source project to help people deploying proper configured docker swarm clusters on AWS.

You'll find other and simpler tutorials or github projects to deploy swarm on AWS, but if you don't want your cluster to be exposed on public facing IPs, you'll then have to get your hands dirty on a lot of other things. 

This project tries to compile a lot of resources to get a swarm cluster up and running on a private aws cloud.

Swarmer is built on top of the following components:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for provisioning the infrastructure
- [Packer](http://packer.io/) for building the boxes for various providers (Virtualbox, AWS, Kvm, ...)
- [Consul](http://consul.io) for service discovery, DNS
- [Docker](http://docker.io) for application container runtimes, of course
- [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) for running the swarm cluster in virtualbox

* Pre-Requisites

To use this project you will need at least this list of tools properly installed on your box:

- docker 1.10
- gnu make 4.1
- vagrant 1.8
- virtualbox 5.0

** With docker [Recommanded]

You can then use the provided docker [[file:Dockerfile][container]] to avoid installing the entire toolbox on your computer by either using the image available on the docker hub or by building it yourself.

*** Use the image

#+NAME: use the image
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --rm -it yanndegat/swarmer
bash-4.3# ...
#+END_SRC


*** Build the image

#+NAME: build the image
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make latest
docker run --rm -it swarmer
bash-4.3# ...
#+END_SRC


** Without docker

If you chose not to use the docker image, you will have to install those additional tools :

- terraform 0.6.14
- packer 0.8.6
- python 2.7
- awscli (pip install awscli)
- gnupg 2.1
- jq 1.5
- curl


* Getting Started

Once you have all the required tools installed on your box, you can follow this guide to setup a swarm cluster on your machine or on your AWS account.

** Swarmer Components

*** Architecture guidelines

- Every component of the system must be able to boot/reboot without having to be provisionned with configuration elements other than via cloud init.
- Every component of the system must be able to discover its pairs and join them
- If a component can't boot properly, it must die.

*** Swarmer is architectured with the following components :

- a consul cluster setup, which consists of a set of consul agents running in "server" mode, and additionnal nodes running in "agent" mode.
  The consul cluster will be used :
  - as a distributed key/value store
  - as a service discovery
  - as a dns server
  - as a backend for swarm master election

- a swarm cluster setup, which consists of a set of swarm agents running in "server" mode, and additionnal nodes running in agent mode.
  Every swarm node will also run a consul agent and a registrator service to declare every running container in consul.

Some nodes could play both "consul server" and "swarm server" roles to avoid booting too many servers for small cluster setups.


** Try Swarmer on your box with Vagrant

Things shouldn't be harder than a single vagrant up. Nodes configuration is located in the [[file:servers.yml.example][servers.yml.example]] file. By default it will boot 3 servers with 1cpu/1g ram. You can edit this file to adjust it to your needs. But before booting any server, you will need to build the vagrant boxes!

*** Building the boxes

There are 3 boxes which have to be built: 
- a base box,
- a consul box which inherits from the base box
- a swarm box which inherits from the consul box

**** Base box
The base box is based on the 991.0.0 coreos iso image. This box will be used as a parent box for the consul and swarm boxes. As its build is pretty long and isn't very reliable, this basebox is mainly useful to speed the build phase of the consul and swarm boxes.

It contains the vagrant insecure public key.

#+NAME: build the base box
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd packer/consul
make coreos-ovf
...
#+END_SRC


**** Consul box
The consul box is based on the coreos-ovf base image previously built. It contains :

- a systemd consul service that will boot a consul agent, configured through a cloud-init userdata configuration.
- a systemd docker configurator service to ease the configuration of the docker engine through cloud-init

#+NAME: build the base box
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd packer/consul
make vbox
...
#+END_SRC


**** Swarm box
The swarm box is based on the consul base ovf image previously built. It contains :

- a systemd swarm service that will boot a swarm agent, configured through a cloud-init userdata configuration.
- a systemd docker registrator service that will declare every running docker container to its local consul agent.

#+NAME: build the base box
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd packer/swarm
make vbox
....
#+END_SRC

*** Using the swarm cluster

You can now use your swarm cluster to run docker containers as simply as you would do to run a container on your local docker engine. All you have to do is 
target the IP of one of your swarm node. 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export DOCKER_HOST=192.168.101.101:4000
docker pull alpine
docker run --rm -it alpine /bin/sh
/ # ...
#+END_SRC


*** Troubleshootings

**** Check the consul agents
Try to connect to any of your nodes through ssh and list the members of your consul cluster.

The status of each node should be "alive". If its not the case, try to reboot the failing nodes.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
vagrant ssh swarm-01
CoreOS alpha (991.0.0)
core@swarm-01 ~ $ /opt/scripts/consul/consul members
Node        Address               Status  Type    Build  Protocol  DC

'swarm-02'  192.168.101.102:8301  alive   server  0.6.3  2         vagrant
'swarm-03'  192.168.101.103:8301  alive   server  0.6.3  2         vagrant
#+END_SRC


**** Check the swarm agents
Try to connect to your nodes and check if every node has its swarm agents running. 
Each node shall have at least one registrator and one swarm-agent containers running. Server nodes have an additional swarm-manager container running.

If every agents are present on every node, but the swarm cluster is failing, try to inspect the logs of the agents.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

**** Check the systemd services

If the agents aren't running, check for any systemd service error with journalctl and systemctl.


** Try Swarmer on your Amazon AWS Account

Things should be a "little bit harder" than a single vagrant up ;)
Before booting the instances, we will have to create an ssh keypair and then install a brand new multi-az VPC, with its nat gateways and public and private subnets. We will also add a bastion instance to allow remote ssh connections to the instances that will boot within your VPC.

Then we can boot the Swarmer instances on the proper subnets.

We provide scripts to allow different kind of setups. Feel free to customize them to better suit your needs.

IMPORTANT: All of these actions will be performed by terraform. As your setup on AWS could be more than just a "dev environment", terraform store the state of our infrastructure in S3, allowing multiple users to retrieve/update the infrastructure.

*** Init S3, Keypair and AMIs

A script is provided to initialize the creation of the required resources: 

- a s3 bucket
- a keypair
- the amis

The keypair will be encrypted with gpg and uploaded to the s3 bucket, so that it can be shared with other members of a team.

We will show an example using the docker swarmer image.

#+END_SRC

IMPORTANT! As this step builds severals AMIs it can be pretty long. Coffee time.


*** Create the VPC

A script is provided to create a VPC and all its associated resources.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --rm -it \ 
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="[AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]" \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]" \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="[AWS_REGION]" \
  -e STACK_NAME="myswarmer" \
  -e AWS_ACCOUNT="[AWS_ACCOUNT]" \
   swarmer terraform/aws/scripts/dc-multi-az-vpc.sh bootstrap
...

Apply complete! Resources: 30 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.

State path: .terraform/terraform.tfstate

Outputs:

  availability_zones        = eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b
  bastion_ip                = 53.40.250.156
  dns_domain_name           = myswarmer
  dns_zone_id               = Z31337FAKAECW63O
  key_name                  = myswarmer-keypair
  security_group            = sg-2c2d3048
  subnet_id_zone_a          = subnet-3f0ff45b
  subnet_id_zone_b          = subnet-ebfc1f9d
  subnet_ids                = subnet-3f0ff45b,subnet-ebfc1f9d
  swarmer_access_key_id     = FAKEI7WKFAKEIUIFAKE
  swarmer_access_key_secret = +FAK+FAKEFAKES75Eb5FAKE5LSZFAKE5nq1ypOGFAKE
  vpc_id                    = vpc-aa2e3ecf

#+END_SRC

This step takes normally less than 5 minutes.


*** Create the Swarm!

Now that you have a proper VPC bootstrapped, you can deploy your swarm instance into it. 

You have several choices of deployment :

- separated consul servers from swarm nodes
- separated swarm managers from swarm nodes
- single/multi availability zones deployment

It is commonly accepted that, for small clusters (up to 10 nodes), you can colocate your swarm managers with your swarm agents and have as many managers as agents.
Yet, it is not recommanded to have a lot of consul servers. From 3 to 6 is a good choice for reliability. More and the gossip protocol and sync process will start downgrading performances.

Here we will boot a 6 nodes swarm clusters spanned on 2 availability zones, with one consul server by swarm node. That way, if an avaibility zone goes down, consul still has 3 nodes to make a quorum for master election.

Terraform is the tool used to bootstrap the instance. Also several building blocks are available to help you quickly bootstrap a cluster. Some example bash scripts demonstrate how to use those terraform building blocks. Feel free to add/create/modify them to get the infrastructure that better suits your requirements.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --rm -it \ 
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="[AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]" \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]" \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="[AWS_REGION]" \
  -e STACK_NAME="myswarmer" \
  -e AWS_ACCOUNT="[AWS_ACCOUNT]" \
   swarmer terraform/aws/scripts/dc-multi-az-simple-swarm.sh bootstrap
...

Apply complete! Resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.

#+END_SRC


*** Configure your access to your swarm cluster

Your cluster is located on a private subnet with no public facing IP. To be able to target it or simply connect to it, you have to establish ssh connections or tunnels through the bastion instance of the VPC. As it can be quite an annoying step, we've made a simple script which generates an ssh config and download the private key that you'll have to copy in your local ssh directory ( probably ~/.ssh ).

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --rm -it \ 
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="[AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]" \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]" \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="[AWS_REGION]" \

#+END_SRC

You will notice that there is one entry per host, plus one global entry matching every ip beginning with 10.233.*. This uncommon /16 subnet has been chosen to avoid IP overlapping with your privates subnets. It can be configured if it doesn't suits you. See [[file:terraform/aws/vpc/variables.tf]]. 

IMPORTANT! Only the hosts that are "up" are added to the config. By "up", we mean that they have at least joined the consul cluster. If you have no host in the config, retrieve the privates ips of your instances through the aws console and ssh into them using their private IP; the global "10.233.*" is dedicated to this.

You'll also notice that each entry refers to a "myswarmer.key". This is the private ssh key that has been generated during the init phase and uploaded to s3.


*** Play with your swarm cluster

Now we can play with swarm.

**** SSH to a node

#+END_SRC


**** Deploy a docker container

Quite simple... ( don't forget to launch the ssh tunnel )

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export DOCKER_HOST=localhost:4000
docker run --rm -it alpine /bin/sh
/ # echo "let's play with docker swarm!"
#+END_SRC


*** Destroy the cluster and the vpc

You can destroy the resources with the same scripts used to terraform by simply replacing the "bootstrap" command with "destroy"


*** Debugging

The best way to debug the system is to run the docker tool container with the proper env vars set, and attached to your src volume. You still have to get familiar with terraform, which is not the purpose of this guide.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --rm -it \ 
  -v $(pwd):/src
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="[AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]" \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]" \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="[AWS_REGION]" \
  -e STACK_NAME="myswarmer" \
  -e AWS_ACCOUNT="[AWS_ACCOUNT]" \
   swarmer 
bash-4.3# ...
#+END_SRC


* Considerations & Roadmap

** Use docker-machine
We may later consider using docker-machine to install & configure the swarm agents. We would then benefit proper & secured configurations.


** Run consul and swarm services as docker containers
There are some caveats running the system services as docker containers, even on coreos. The main problem is the process supervision with systemd, as full described in this [[https://lwn.net/Articles/676831/][article]]. That said, the coreos rocket container engine could be considered as a suitable alternative.


** Monitoring
There is no monitoring yet, and no centralized log system configured either.

** Server.yml to bootstrap AWS
It would be nice if the server.yml could be used as input to terraform an AWS setup.


** Running on GCE

** Running on Azure

** Running on premise
